<h1>MongoDB CRUD with Flash Messages</h1>
<h3>Simple Mongo DB Create, Read, Update and Delete request.</h3>

<p> I created simple CRUD with Mongo database. To see all functions i added User Managment system, where you can create user, edit user, delete user and show all users in simple table</p>

<p> I added Flash messages to this UMS to get responses from server when requests are done. </p>
